def getOptimalAssemblyOrientation(assembly, aPrev):
    """
    Get optimal assembly orientation/rotation to minimize peak burnup.

    Notes
    -----
    Works by placing the highest-BU pin in the location (of 6 possible locations) with lowest
    expected pin power. We evaluated "expected pin power" based on the power distribution in
    aPrev, which is the previous assembly located here. If aPrev has no pin detail, then we must
    use its corner fast fluxes to make an estimate.

    Parameters
    ----------
    assembly : Assembly object
        The assembly that is being rotated.
    aPrev : Assembly object
        The assembly that previously occupied this location (before the last shuffle).
        If the assembly "assembly" was not shuffled, then "aPrev" = "assembly".
        If "aPrev" has pin detail, then we will determine the orientation of "assembly" based on
        the pin powers of "aPrev" when it was located here.
        If "aPrev" does NOT have pin detail, then we will determine the orientation of "assembly"
        based on the corner fast fluxes in "aPrev" when it was located here.

    Returns
    -------
    rot : int
        An integer from 0 to 5 representing the "orientation" of the assembly.
        This orientation is relative to the current assembly orientation.
        rot = 0 corresponds to no rotation.
        rot represents the number of pi/3 counterclockwise rotations for the default orientation.
